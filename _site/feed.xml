        <title>My First Week at Byte Academy</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;intro&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dropcap&quot;&gt;I&lt;/span&gt;want to be a programmer. It took me
a while to figure it out, but now I am sure. So sure, that I signed up for a 12-week programming bootcamp at &lt;a href=&quot;http://byteacademy.co/&quot;&gt;Byte Academy&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was prepared; I taught myself Java, some HMTL/CSS and a little bit of Ruby before starting. I also finished all the prep-work they gave us before the class started. Still, it&amp;#39;s tough. There was no introduction to Python, the language we are learning the first four weeks, -we were expected to have a solid grasp of it already and just jump right in to complex problems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It feels fantastic to be a student again. It&amp;#39;s been more than ten years since I walked out of
a business school with a master&amp;#39;s degree in my hand. That degree and all the experience gained in a bunch of different jobs during my studies and the following years brought me where I am at right now. Everything changes and nothing stands still. I can do this.&lt;/p&gt;
