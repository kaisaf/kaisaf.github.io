<p class="intro"><span class="dropcap">I</span> want to be a programmer. It took me a while to figure it out, but now I am sure. So sure, that I signed up for a 12-week programming bootcamp at <a href="http://byteacademy.co/">Byte Academy</a>. 


I was prepared; I taught myself Java, some HMTL/CSS and a little bit of Ruby before starting. I also finished all the prep-work they gave us before the class started. Still, it's tough. There was no introduction to Python, the language we are learning the first four weeks, -we were expected to have a solid grasp of it already and just jump right in to complex problems.

It feels fantastic to be a student again. It's been more than ten years since I walked out of
a business school with a master's degree in my hand. That degree and all the experience gained in a bunch of different jobs during my studies and the following years brought me where I am at right now. Everything changes and nothing stands still. I can do this.
